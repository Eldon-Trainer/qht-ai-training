# QHT AI Training ‚Äî Streamlit Prototype


## Files
- `app.py` ‚Äî main Streamlit app (paste into GitHub as the app file)
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äî Python dependencies to install
- `README.md` ‚Äî this file

## Deployment (Streamlit Cloud)
1. Create a GitHub repository and push these files (or use the GitHub web UI to create them).
2. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/ and sign in with GitHub.
3. Click **New app** ‚Üí select the repository and branch (usually `main`) ‚Üí set the main file path to `app.py` ‚Üí click **Deploy**.
4. In your Streamlit app page, go to **Settings ‚Üí Secrets** and add:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` = `sk-...` (your OpenAI API key)
5. Reload the app. The app will now be able to call OpenAI APIs for transcription and scoring.

## Notes
- The prototype accepts typed answers or an uploaded audio file (mp3/wav). For an in-browser microphone recorder, additional work (e.g., `streamlit-webrtc`) is needed.
- Keep your OpenAI API key secret ‚Äî don‚Äôt commit it to GitHub. Use Streamlit Secrets or environment variables.
